# DRAPS
DRAPS (Drone-Resilient Active Protection System) is a C++ simulator that explores and prototypes next-generation active protection technologies designed to defend against modern aerial drone threats. It models current APS systems and simulates enhancements to address evolving challenges such as autonomous drone swarms, loitering munitions, and low-cost UAV saturation tactics. DRAPS focuses on adaptability, real-time threat prioritization, and cost-efficient countermeasures for the future battlefield.
